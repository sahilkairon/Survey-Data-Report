# Survey-Data-Report
In this project I used Power BI to make report of the data that we got from recent survey.  I loaded the data form an Excel sheet and used Power Query to clean the data. After cleaning the data I used Power BI report view to create the dashboard. 
Information that is  present in the dashboard is:- 
TreeMap of country of the people who took this survey. 
Stacked Bar chart of Average Salary by JOb Title. 
Count of Survey Takers. 
Average age of Survey Takers. 
Stacked column chart of favourite programming language of people who took the survey. 
Donut chart of Average Salary by Gender of people who took the survey.
Gauge of Happiness by Salary
